The GAP 4 package `NumericalSgps` to compute with Numerical Semigroups
======================================================================

Introduction
------------

This is release 1.0 of  the package `NumericalSgps`.

The features of this package include

- defining numerical semigroups;
- computing several properties of numerical semigroups, namely: multiplicity, Frobenius number, (minimal) system of generators, Apéry set, gaps, fundamental gaps, etc.;
- perform several operations on numerical semigroups and ideals, namely: intersection, quotient by an integer, decompose into irreducible semigroups, add a special gap, ...;
-computing and testing membership to relevant families of numerical semigroups.

There is a manual in the sub-directory 'doc' written using the GAP package
gapdoc which describes the available functions in detail. The dvi, pdf, html
versions of the manual are also available there.

If you have used this package, please let us know by sending
us an email.  If you  have found important features missing or if there is a
bug, we would appreciate it very much if you send us an email.

The current maintainers of the package are:

Manuel Delgado			<mdelgado@fc.up.pt>

Pedro A. García-Sánchez		<pedro@ugr.es>

Contents
--------
With this version you should have obtained the following files and
directories:

| File/directory | Description |
|:-----|:------|
|README |   this file|
|EXAMPLES|	some examples|
|CHANGES|	changelog|
|doc  |	the manual|
|gap  |the GAP code|
|init.g| the file that initializes this package|
|read.g |         		the file that reads in the package|
|PackageInfo.g	| information file for automatic processing|
|version	|the version number|

Usage
-----
The package is distributed with the main GAP archive. In order to use it you
just have to start GAP and type

      LoadPackage( "numericalsgps" );

-----

For updates between releases of GAP itself check the package web page

	https://bitbucket.org/gap-system/numericalsgps

Unpacking
---------

You may get `NumericalSgps` as a compressed tar archive (file name ends with
.tar.gz). Use the  appropriate  command  on  your system   to unpack the
archive.

On UNIX systems the compressed tar archive may be unpacked by

    tar xzf numericalsgps-<version>.tar.gz

or, if tar on your system does not understand the option z, by

    gunzip numericalsgps-<version>.tar.gz
    tar xf numericalsgps-<version>.tar

which will in each case unpack the code into a directory 'numericalsgps'
in the current directory. We assume that the current directory is the
directory /usr/local/lib/gap4r7/pkg/.

Installation
------------

Copy the folder 'numericalsgp' to your pkg gap folder (for instance /usr/local/lib/gap4r7/pkg).
You can also place it somewhere else and then use the command `SetPackagePath`:

	SetPackagePath("numericalsgps","whereveryouwant/numericalsgps");

or add this line to your `gaprc`.

In order to check the installation, launch `gap`:

	gap

Then try the following
```gap
gap> LoadPackage( "numericalsgps" );
true
gap>
```
Good luck!

You can also add the line
```gap
LoadPackage( "numericalsgps" );
```
to your `gaprc` file.

In other systems, there are equivalent ways to do the same.
# GitHubPagesForGAP

This repository can be used to quickly set up a website hosted by
[GitHub](https://github.com/) for GAP packages using a GitHub repository.
Specifically, this uses [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
by adding a `gh-pages` branch to your package repository which
contains data generated from the `PackageInfo.g` file of your package.

## Initial setup

The following instructions assume you do not already have a `gh-pages`
branch in your repository. If you do have one, you should delete it before
following these instructions.

1. Go into your clone of your package repository.

2. Setup a `gh-pages` branch in a `gh-pages` subdirectory.

   Users with a recent enough git version (recommended is >= 2.11)
   can do this using a "worktree", via the following commands:

   ```sh
   # Add a new remote pointing to the GitHubPagesForGAP repository
   git remote add gh-gap https://github.com/fingolfin/GitHubPagesForGAP
   git fetch gh-gap

   # Create a fresh gh-pages branch from the new remote
   git branch gh-pages gh-gap/gh-pages --no-track

   # Create a new worktree and change into it
   git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
   cd gh-pages
   ```

   Everybody else should instead do the following, with the URL
   in the initial clone command suitably adjusted:

   ```sh
   # Create a fresh clone of your repository, and change into it
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY gh-pages
   cd gh-pages

   # Add a new remote pointing to the GitHubPagesForGAP repository
   git remote add gh-gap https://github.com/fingolfin/GitHubPagesForGAP
   git fetch gh-gap

   # Create a fresh gh-pages branch from the new remote
   git checkout -b gh-pages gh-gap/gh-pages --no-track
   ```

5. Add in copies of your PackageInfo.g, README and manual:

   ```
   cp -f ../PackageInfo.g ../README .
   cp -f ../doc/*.{css,html,js,txt} doc/
   ```

6. Now run the `update.g` GAP script. This extracts data from your
   `PackageInfo.g` file and puts that data into `_data/package.yml`.
   From this, the website template can populate the web pages with
   some sensible default values.

   ```
   gap update.g
   ```

7. Commit and push everything.

   ```
   git add PackageInfo.g README doc/ _data/package.yml
   git commit -m "Setup gh-pages based on GitHubPagesForGAP"
   git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
   ```

That's it. You can now see your new package website under
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/ (of course after
adjusting USERNAME and REPOSITORY suitably).


## Adjusting the content and layout

GitHubPagesForGAP tries to automatically provide good defaults for
most packages. However, you can tweak everything about it:

* To adjust the page layout, edit the files `stylesheets/styles.css`
and `_layouts/default.html`.

* To adjust the content of the front page, edit `index.md` (resp.
  for the content of the sidebar, edit `_layouts/default.html`

* You can also add additional pages, in various formats (HTML,
Markdown, Textile, ...).

For details, please consult the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
manual.


## Testing the site locally

If you would like to test your site on your own machine, without
uploading it to GitHub (where it is visible to the public), you can do
so by installing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static web site
generator used by GitHub to power GitHub Pages.

Once you have installed Jekyll as described on its homepage, you can
test the website locally as follows:

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.

2. Run jekyll (this launches a tiny web server on your machine):

   ```
   jekyll serve -w
   ```

3. Visit the URL http://localhost:4000 in a web browser.


## Updating after you made a release

Whenever you make a release of your package (and perhaps more often than
that), you will want to update your website. The easiest way is to use
the `release` script from the [ReleaseTools][]. However, you can also do
it manually. The steps for doing it are quite similar to the above:

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.

2. Add in copies of your PackageInfo.g, README and manual:

   ```
   cp -f ../PackageInfo.g ../README .
   cp -f ../doc/*.{css,html,js,txt} doc/
   ```

3. Now run the `update.g` GAP script.

4. Commit and push the work we have just done.

   ```
   git add PackageInfo.g README doc/ _data/package.yml
   git commit -m "Update web pages"
   git push
   ```

A few seconds after you have done this, your changes will be online
under https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/ .


## Updating to a newer version of GitHubPagesForGAP

Normally you should not have to ever do this. However, if you really want to,
you can attempt to update to the most recent version of GitHubPagesForGAP via
the following instructions. The difficulty of such an update depends on how
much you tweaked the site after initially cloning GitHubPagesForGAP.

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.
   Make sure that there are no uncommitted changes, as they will be lost
   when following these instructions.

2. Fetch changes made to GitHubPagesForGAP.
   ```
   git fetch gh-gap
   ```

3. Attempt to merge these changes. This may produce multiple merge conflicts,
   so ideally, you should be familiar with dealing with such merge conflicts.
   ```
   git pull gh-gap gh-pages
   ```
   If at any point you don't know how to continue, you can abort the merge
   process and revert to the original state by issuing this command:
   ```
   git merge --abort
   ```

4. This may produce merge conflicts. Most likely you will have conflicts in
   the file `_data/package.yml`, but these are easy to resolve as follows:
   ```
   gap update.g
   git add _data/package.yml
   ```
   If you are lucky, this is the only conflict (check with `git status`).
