  recommended  for  many  of the functions presented in this chapter. However,
  whenever  possible a method not depending on these packages is also provided
  (though  slower).  The  package  tests if the user has downloaded any of the
  above  packages,  and if so puts [10XNumSgpsCanUsePackage[110X to true, where [10XPackage[110X
