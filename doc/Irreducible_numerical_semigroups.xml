                    Irreducible numerical semigroups
                </Heading>
                An irreducible numerical semigroup is a semigroup that cannot be expressed as the 
                intersection of numerical semigroups properly containing it. 
                <P/>
                
                It is not difficult to prove that a semigroup is irreducible if and only if it is 
                maximal (with respect to set inclusion) in the set of all numerical semigroup having
                its same Frobenius number (see <Cite Key="RB03"></Cite>). Hence, according to 
                <Cite Key="FGH87"></Cite> (respectively <Cite Key="BDF97"></Cite>), 
                symmetric (respectively pseudo-symmetric) numerical semigroups are those irreducible 
                numerical semigroups with odd (respectively even) Frobenius number.
                <P/>
                
                In <Cite Key="RGGJ03"></Cite> it is shown that a nontrivial numerical semigroup is irreducible if and 
                only if it has only one special gap. We use this characterization.
                <P/>
                
                In this section we show how to construct the set of all numerical semigroups with a 
                given Frobenius number. In old versions of the package, we first constructed an irreducible numerical semigroup with 
                the given Frobenius number (as explained in <Cite Key="RGS04"></Cite>), and then 
                we constructed the rest from it. That is why we separated both functions. 
				The present version uses a faster procedure presented in <Cite Key="BR13"></Cite>.
                <P/>
                
                Every numerical semigroup can be expressed as an intersection of irreducible 
                numerical semigroups. If <M>S</M> can be expressed as <M>S=S_1\cap \cdots\cap S_n</M>,
                with <M>S_i</M> irreducible numerical semigroups, and no factor can be removed, then
                we say that this decomposition is minimal. Minimal decompositions can be computed by 
                using Algorithm 26 in <Cite Key="RGGJ03"></Cite>.
