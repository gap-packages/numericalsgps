        Defining affine semigroups
    </Heading>

    An affine semigroup <M>S</M> is a finitely generated cancellative monoid that is reduced (no units other than 0) and is torsion-free (<M> a s= b s</M> implies <M>a=b</M>, with <M>a,b\in \mathbb N</M> and <M>s\in S</M>).

    Up to isomorphisms any affine semigroup can be viewed as a finitely generated submonoid of <M>\mathbb N^k</M> for some positive integer <M>k</M>. Thus affine semigroups are a natural generalization of numerical semigroups.

    The most common way to give an affine semigroup is by any of its systems of generators. As for numerical semigroups, any affine semigroup admits a unique minimal system of generators. A system of generators can be represented as a list of lists of nonnegative integers; all lists in the list having the same length (a matrix actually).

    If <M>G</M> is a subgroup of <M>\mathbb Z^k</M>, then <M>S=G\cap \mathbb N^k</M> is an affine semigroup (these semigroups are called full affine semigroups). As <M>G</M> can be represented by its defining equations (homogeneous and some of them possibly in congruences), we can represent <M>S</M> by the defining equations of <M>G</M>; indeed <M>S</M> is just the set of nonnegative solutions of this system of equations. We can represent the equations as a list of lists of integers, all with the same length. Every list is a row of the matrix of coefficients of the system of equations. For the equations in congruences, if we arrange them so that they are the first ones in the list, we provide the corresponding moduli in a list. So for instance, the equations <M>x+y\equiv 0\bmod 2,\ x-2y=0</M> will be represented as [[1,1],[1,-2]] and the moduli [2].
    <P/>

As happens with numerical semigroups, there are different ways to specify an affine semigroup <M>S</M>, namely, by means of a system of generators, a system of homogeneous linear Diophantine equations or a system of homogeneous linear Diophantine inequalities, just to mention some.
In this section we describe functions that may be used
to specify, in one of these ways, an affine semigroup  in &GAP;.

  <P/>
  There are four methods implemented for this function, depending on the packages loaded. All of them use elimination, and Herzog's correspondence, computing the kernel of a ring homomorphism (<Cite Key="MR0269762"></Cite>). The fastest procedure is achieved when <C>SingularInterface</C> is loaded, followed by <C>Singular</C>. The procedure that does not use external packages uses internal GAP Gröbner basis computations and thus it is slower. Also in this case, from the Gröbner basis, a minimal set of generating binomials must be refined, and for this Rclasses are used (if <C>NormalizInterface</C> is loaded, then the factorizations are faster). The <C>4ti2</C> implementation uses <C>4ti2</C> internal Gröbner bases and factorizations are done via <C>zsolve</C>.

    Factorizations in affine semigroups
  </Heading>

  The invariants presented here are defined as for numerical semigroups.

  <P/>As with presentations, the user should take into account that generators are stored in a set, and thus might be arranged in a different way to the initial input.

    <Func Arg="v, ls" Name="FactorizationsVectorWRTList"></Func>
    <Description>
      <A>v</A> is a list of nonnegative integers and <A>ls</A> is a list of lists of nonnegative integers.
      The output is set of factorizations of <A>v</A> in terms of the elements of <A>ls</A>.
  <P/>
  If no extra package is loaded, then factorizations are computed recursively; and thus slowly. If <C>NormalizInterface</C> is loaded, then a system of equations is solved with Normaliz, and the performance is much better. If <C>4ti2Interface</C> is loaded instead, then factorizations are calculated using <C>zsolve</C> command of <C>4ti2</C>.
