                    Almost-symmetric numerical semigroups
                </Heading>


				A numerical semigroup is almost-symmetric (<Cite Key="BF97"></Cite>) if its genus is the arithmetic mean of its Frobenius number and type. 
				We use a procedure presented in <Cite Key="RGS13"></Cite> to determine the set of all almost-symmetric numerical semigroups with given Frobenius 
				number. In order to do this, we first calculate the set of all almost-symmetric numerical semigroups that can be constructed from an irreducible
				numerical semigroup.

                    <Description>
                        <A>s</A> is an irreducible numerical semigroup.  The output is the set of almost-symetric numerical semigroups that can be constructed 
						from <A>s</A> by removing some of its generators as explained in <Cite Key="RGS13"></Cite>).
