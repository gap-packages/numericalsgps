{
  A \emph{numerical semigroup} is a subset of the set $ {\mathbb N} $ of nonnegative integers that is closed under addition, contains $0$ and whose complement in $ {\mathbb N} $ is finite. The smallest positive integer belonging to a numerical semigroup is
its \emph{multiplicity}. 

 Let $S$ be a numerical semigroup and $A$ be a subset of $S$. We say that $A$ is a \emph{system of generators} of $S$ if $S=\{ k_1 a_1+\cdots+ k_n a_n\ |\ n,k_1,\ldots,k_n\in{\mathbb N},
a_1,\ldots,a_n\in A\}$. The set $A$ is a \emph{minimal system of generators} of $S$ if no proper subset of $A$ is a system of generators of $S$. 

 Every numerical semigroup has a unique minimal system of generators. This is a
data that can be used in order to uniquely define a numerical semigroup.
Observe that since the complement of a numerical semigroup in the set of
nonnegative integers is finite, this implies that the greatest common divisor
of the elements of a numerical semigroup is 1, and the same condition must be
fulfilled by its minimal system of generators (or by any of its systems of
generators). 

 Given a numerical semigroup $S$ and a nonzero element $s$ in it, one can consider for every integer $i$ ranging from $0$ to $s-1$, the smallest element in $S$ congruent with $i$ modulo $s$, say $w(i)$ (this element exists since the complement of $S$ in ${\mathbb N}$ is finite). Clearly $w(0)=0$. The set ${\rm Ap}(S,s)=\{ w(0),w(1),\ldots, w(s-1)\}$ is called the \label{zl1}\emph{Ap{\a'e}ry set} of $S$ with respect to $s$. Note that a nonnegative integer $x$ congruent with $i$ modulo $s$ belongs to $S$ if and only if $w(i)\leq x$. Thus the pair $(s,{\rm Ap}(S,s))$ fully determines the numerical semigroup $S$ (and can be used to easily solve the membership problem to $S$). This set is in fact one of the most powerfull tools known for numerical
semigroups, and it is used almost everywhere in the computation of components
and invariants associated to a numerical semigroup. Usually the element $s$ is taken to be the multiplicity, since in this way the resulting Ap{\a'e}ry
set is the smallest possible. 

 A \label{xx1}\emph{gap} of a numerical semigroup $S$ is a nonnegative integer not belonging to $S$. The set of gaps of $S$ is usually denoted by ${\rm H}(S)$, and clearly determines uniquely $S$. Note that if $x$ is a gap of $S$, then so are all the nonnegative integers dividing it. Thus in order to
describe $S$ we do not need to know all its gaps, but only those that are maximal with
respect to the partial order induced by division in ${\mathbb N}$. These gaps are called \label{lab1}\emph{fundamental gaps}. 

 The largest nonnegative integer not belonging to a numerical semigroup $S$ is the \emph{Frobenius number} of $S$. If $S$ is the set of nonnegative integers, then clearly its Frobenius number is $-1$, otherwise its Frobenius number coincides with the maximum of the gaps (or
fundamental gaps) of $S$. The Frobenius number plus one is known as the \emph{conductor} of the semigroup. In this package we refer to the elements in the semigroup
that are less than or equal to the conductor as \label{zlab1}\emph{small elements} of the semigroup. Observe that from the definition, if $S$ is a numerical semigroup with Frobenius number $f$, then $f+{\mathbb N}\setminus\{0\}\subseteq S$. An integer $z$ is a \label{lab2}\emph{pseudo-Frobenius number} of $S$ if $z+S\setminus\{0\}\subseteq S$. Thus the Frobenius number of $S$ is one of its pseudo-Frobenius numbers. The \emph{type} of a numerical semigroup is the cardinality of the set of its pseudo-Frobenius
numbers. 

 The number of numerical semigroups having a given Frobenius number is finite.
The elements in this set of numerical semigroups that are maximal with respect
to set inclusion are precisely those numerical semigroups that cannot be
expressed as intersection of two other numerical semigroups containing them
properly, and thus they are known as \emph{irreducible} numerical semigroups. Clearly, every numerical semigroup is the intersection
of (finitely many) irreducible numerical semigroups. 

 A numerical semigroup $S$ with Frobenius number $f$ is \emph{symmetric} if for every integer $x$, either $x\in S$ or $f-x\in S$. The set of irreducible numerical semigroups with odd Frobenius number
coincides with the set of symmetric numerical semigroups. The numerical
semigroup $S$ is \emph{pseudo-symmetric} if $f$ is even and for every integer $x$ not equal to $f/2$ either $x\in S$ or $f-x\in S$. The set of irreducible numerical semigroups with even Frobenius number is
precisely the set of pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups. These two classes
of numerical semigroups have been widely studied in the literature due to
their nice applications in Algebraic Geometry. This is probably one of the
main reasons that made people turn their attention on numerical semigroups
again in the last decades. Symmetric numerical semigroups can be also
characterized as those with type one, and pseudo-symmetric numerical
semigroups are those numerical semigroups with type two and such that its
pseudo-Frobenius numbers are its Frobenius number and its Frobenius number
divided by two. 

 Another class of numerical semigroups that catched the attention of
researchers working on Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Ring Theory is the
class of numerical semigroups with maximal embedding dimension. The \emph{embedding dimension} of a numerical semigroup is the cardinality of its minimal system of
generators. It can be shown that the embedding dimension is at most the
multiplicity of the numerical semigroup. Thus \emph{maximal embedding dimension} numerical semigroups are those numerical semigroups for which their embedding
dimension and multiplicity coincide. These numerical semigroups have nice
maximal properties, not only (of course) related to their embedding dimension,
but also by means of their presentations. Among maximal embedding dimension
there are two classes of numerical semigroups that have been studied due to
the connections with the equivalence of algebroid branches. A numerical
semigroup $S$ is Arf if for every $x\geq y\geq z\in S$, then $x+y-z\in S$; and it is \emph{saturated} if the following condition holds: if $s,s_1,\ldots,s_r\in S$ are such that $s_i\leq s$ for all $i\in \{1,\ldots,r\}$ and $z_1,\ldots,z_r\in {\mathbb Z}$ are such that $z_1s_1+\cdots+z_rs_r\geq 0$, then $s+z_1s_1+\cdots +z_rs_r\in S$. 

 If we look carefully inside the set of fundamental gaps of a numerical
semigroup, we see that there are some fulfilling the condition that if they
are added to the given numerical semigroup, then the resulting set is again a
numerical semigroup. These elements are called \label{lab3}\emph{special gaps} of the numerical semigroup. A numerical semigroup other than the set of
nonnegative integers is irreducible if and only if it has only a special gap. 

 The inverse operation to the one described in the above paragraph is that of
removing an element of a numerical semigroup. If we want the resulting set to
be a numerical semigroup, then the only thing we can remove is a minimal
generator. 

 Let $a,b,c,d$ be positive integers such that $a/b < c/d$, and let $I=[a/b,c/d]$. Then the set ${\rm S}(I)={\mathbb N}\cap \bigcup_{n\geq 0} n I$ is a numerical semigroup. This class of numerical semigroups coincides with
that of sets of solutions to equations of the form $ A x \ mod\ B \leq C x$ with $ A,B,C$ positive integers. A numerical semigroup in this class is said to be \label{llab1}\emph{proportionally modular}. 

 A sequence of positive rational numbers $ a_1/b_1 < \cdots < a_n/b_n$ with $a_i,b_i$ positive integers is a \emph{B{\a'e}zout sequence} if $ a_{i+1}b_i - a_i b_{i+1}=1$ for all $i\in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}$. If $ a/b=a_1/b_1 < \cdots < a_n/b_n =c/d$, then ${\rm S}([a/b,c/d])=\langle a_1,\ldots,a_n\rangle$. B{\a'e}zout sequences are not only interesting for this fact, they have
shown to be a major tool in the study of proportionally modular numerical
semigroups. 

 If $S$ is a numerical semigroup and $k$ is a positive integer, then the set $S/k=\{ x\in {\mathbb N} \ |\ kx\in S\}$ is a numerical semigroup, known as the \emph{quotient} $S$ by $k$. 

 Let $m$ be a positive integer. A \label{llab2}\emph{subadditive} function with period $m$ is a map $f:{\mathbb N}\to {\mathbb N}$ such that $ f(0)=0$, $f(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(x+m)=f(x)$. If $f$ is a subadditive function with period $m$, then the set ${\rm M}_f=\{ x\in {\mathbb N}\ |\ f(x)\leq x\}$ is a numerical semigroup. Moreover, every numerical semigroup is of this form.
Thus a numerical semigroup can be given by a subadditive function with a given
period. If $S$ is a numerical semigroup and $s\in S, s\not=0$, and ${\rm Ap}(S,s)=\{ w(0),w(1),\ldots, w(s-1)\}$, then $f(x)=w(x \ mod\ s)$ is a subadditive function with period $s$ such that ${\rm M}_f=S$. 

 Let $S$ be a numerical semigroup generated by $\{n_1,\ldots,n_k\}$. Then we can define the following morphism (called sometimes the
factorization morphism) by $\varphi: {\mathbb N}^k \to S,\ \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_k)=a_1n_1+\cdots+a_kn_k$. If $\sigma$ is the kernel congruence of $\varphi$ (that is, $a\sigma b$ if $\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)$), then $S$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb N}^k/\sigma$. A \emph{presentation} for $S$ is a system of generators (as a congruence) of $\sigma$. If $\{n_1,\ldots,n_p\}$ is a minimal system of generators, then a \emph{minimal presentation} is a presentation such that none of its proper subsets is a presentation.
Minimal presentations of numerical semigroups coincide with presentations with
minimal cardinality, though in general these two concepts are not the same for
an arbitrary commutative semigroup. 

 A set $I$ of integers is an \emph{ideal relative to a numerical semigroup} $S$ provided that $I+S\subseteq I$ and that there exists $d\in S$ such that $d+I\subseteq S$. If $I\subseteq S$, we simply say that $I$ is an \emph{ideal} of $S$. If $I$ and $J$ are relative ideals of $S$, then so is $I-J=\{z\in {\mathbb Z}\ |\ z+J\subseteq I\}$, and it is tightly related to the operation ":" of ideals in a commutative
ring. 

 In this package we have implemented the functions needed to deal with the
elements exposed in this introduction. 

 Many of the algorithms, and the necessary background to understand them, can
be found in the monograph \cite{RGbook}. Some examples in this book have been illustrated with the help of this
package. So the reader can also find there more examples on the usage of the
functions implemented here. 

 This package was presented in \cite{JMDA}. For a survey of the features of this package, see \cite{MR3493240}. }

  We recall some definitions from Chapter \ref{Intro}. 

 A numerical semigroup is a subset of the set $ {\mathbb N} $ of nonnegative integers that is closed under addition, contains $0$ and whose complement in $ {\mathbb N} $ is finite. 

 We refer to the elements in a numerical semigroup that are less than or equal
to the conductor as \emph{small elements} of the semigroup. 

 A \emph{gap} of a numerical semigroup $S$ is a nonnegative integer not belonging to $S$. The \emph{fundamental gaps} of $S$ are those gaps that are maximal with respect to the partial order induced by
division in ${\mathbb N}$. 

 Given a numerical semigroup $S$ and a nonzero element $s$ in it, one can consider for every integer $i$ ranging from $0$ to $s-1$, the smallest element in $S$ congruent with $i$ modulo $s$, say $w(i)$ (this element exists since the complement of $S$ in ${\mathbb N}$ is finite). Clearly $w(0)=0$. The set ${\rm Ap}(S,s)=\{ w(0),w(1),\ldots, w(s-1)\}$ is called the \emph{Ap{\a'e}ry set} of $S$ with respect to $s$. 

 Let $a,b,c,d$ be positive integers such that $a/b < c/d$, and let $I=[a/b,c/d]$. Then the set ${\rm S}(I)={\mathbb N}\cap \bigcup_{n\geq 0} n I$ is a numerical semigroup. This class of numerical semigroups coincides with
that of sets of solutions to equations of the form $ A x \bmod\ B \leq C x$ with $ A,B,C$ positive integers. A numerical semigroup in this class is said to be \emph{proportionally modular}. If $C = 1$, then it is said to be \emph{modular}. 

 There are different ways to specify a numerical semigroup $S$, namely, by its generators; by its gaps, its fundamental or special gaps by
its Ap{\a'e}ry set, just to name some. In this section we describe functions
that may be used to specify, in one of these ways, a numerical semigroup in \textsf{GAP}.

  This section describes some basic tests on numerical semigroups. The first
described tests refer to what the semigroup is currently known to be (not
necessarily the way it was created). Then are presented functions to test if a
given list represents the small elements, gaps or the Ap{\a'e}ry set (see \ref{zlab1}) of a numerical semigroup; to test if an integer belongs to a numerical
semigroup and if a numerical semigroup is a subsemigroup of another one.

 \texttt{S} is a numerical semigroup and \texttt{p,q} are two elements in \texttt{S}. 

In this setting \texttt{S} is an oversemigroup of $\langle p,q\rangle$, and consequently every gap of \texttt{S} is a gap of $\langle p,q\rangle$. If $c$ is the conductor of $\langle p,q\rangle$, then every gap $g$ of $\langle p,q\rangle$ can be written uniquely as $g=c-1-(ap+bp)$ for some nonnegative integers $a,b$. We say that $(a,b)$ are the coordinates associated to $g$. 

 The output is a path in $\mathbb{N}^2$ such that coordinates of the gaps of $S$ correspond exactly with the points in $\mathbb{N}^2$ that are between the path in the line $ax+by=c-1$. See \cite{K-W}.

 \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is a numerical semigroup. The output is a list of lists with two elements.
Each list of two elements represents a relation between the minimal generators
of the numerical semigroup. If $ \{ \{x_1,y_1\},\ldots,\{x_k,y_k\}\} $ is the output and $ \{m_1,\ldots,m_n\} $ is the minimal system of generators of the numerical semigroup, then $ \{x_i,y_i\}=\{\{a_{i_1},\ldots,a_{i_n}\},\{b_{i_1},\ldots,b_{i_n}\}\}$ and $ a_{i_1}m_1+\cdots+a_{i_n}m_n= b_{i_1}m_1+ \cdots +b_{i_n}m_n.$ 

 Any other relation among the minimal generators of the semigroup can be
deduced from the ones given in the output. 

 The algorithm implemented is described in \cite{Ros96} (see also \cite{RGS99}).

  In this section we show how to construct new numerical semigroups from a given
numerical semigroup. Two dual operations are presented. The first one removes
a minimal generator from a numerical semigroup. The second adds a special gap
to a semigroup (see \cite{RGGJ03}).

  In order to construct the set of numerical semigroups containing a fixed
numerical semigroup $S$, one first constructs its unitary extensions, that is to say, the sets $S\cup\{g\}$ that are numerical semigroups with $g$ a positive integer. This is achieved by constructing the special gaps of the
semigroup, and then adding each of them to the numerical semigroup. Then we
repeat the process for each of this new numerical semigroups until we reach $ {\mathbb N} $.

{
  An irreducible numerical semigroup is a semigroup that cannot be expressed as
the intersection of numerical semigroups properly containing it. 

 It is not difficult to prove that a semigroup is irreducible if and only if it
is maximal (with respect to set inclusion) in the set of all numerical
semigroups having its same Frobenius number (see \cite{RB03}). Hence, according to \cite{FGH87} (respectively \cite{BDF97}), symmetric (respectively pseudo-symmetric) numerical semigroups are those
irreducible numerical semigroups with odd (respectively even) Frobenius
number. 

 In \cite{RGGJ03} it is shown that a nontrivial numerical semigroup is irreducible if and only
if it has only one special gap. We use this characterization. 

 In this section we show how to construct the set of all numerical semigroups
with a given Frobenius number. In old versions of the package, we first
constructed an irreducible numerical semigroup with the given Frobenius number
(as explained in \cite{RGS04}), and then we constructed the rest from it. That is why we separated both
functions. The present version uses a faster procedure presented in \cite{BR13}. 

 Every numerical semigroup can be expressed as an intersection of irreducible
numerical semigroups. If $S$ can be expressed as $S=S_1\cap \cdots\cap S_n$, with $S_i$ irreducible numerical semigroups, and no factor can be removed, then we say
that this decomposition is minimal. Minimal decompositions can be computed by
using Algorithm 26 in \cite{RGGJ03}.

  The cardinality of a minimal presentation of a numerical semigroup is alwas
greater than or equal to its embedding dimension minus one. Complete
intersection numerical semigroups are numerical semigroups reching this bound,
and they are irreducible. It can be shown that every complete intersection
(other that $\mathbb N$) is a complete intersection if and only if it is the gluing of two complete
intersections. When in this gluing, one of the copies is isomorphic to $\mathbb N$, then we obtain a free semigroups in the sense of \cite{BC77}. Two special kinds of free semigroups are telescopic semigroups (\cite{KP95}) and those associated to an irreducible planar curve (\cite{Z86}). We use the algorithms presented in \cite{AGS13} to find the set of all complete intersections (also free, telescopic and
associated to irreducible planar curves) numerical semigroups with given
Frobenius number.

   Let $S$ be a numerical semigroup. A set $I$ of integers is an \emph{ideal relative} to a numerical semigroup $S$ provided that $I+S\subseteq I$ and that there exists $d\in S$ such that $d+I\subseteq S$. 

 If $\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\}$ is a subset of ${\mathbb Z}$, then the set $I=\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\}+S=\bigcup_{n=1}^k i_n+S$ is an ideal relative to $S$, and $\{i_1,\ldots, i_k\}$ is a system of generators of $I$. A system of generators $M$ is minimal if no proper subset of $M$ generates the same ideal. Usually, ideals are specified by means of its
generators and the ambient numerical semigroup to which they are ideals (for
more information see for instance \cite{BDF97}).

  If $S$ is a numerical semigroup and $m$ is its multiplicity (the least positive integer belonging to it), then the
embedding dimension $e$ of $S$ (the cardinality of the minimal system of generators of $S$) is less than or equal to $m$. We say that $S$ has maximal embedding dimension (MED for short) when $e=m$. The intersection of two numerical semigroups with the same multiplicity and
maximal embedding dimension is again of maximal embedding dimension. Thus we
define the MED closure of a non-empty subset of positive integers $M=\{m < m_1 < \cdots < m_n <\cdots\}$ with $\gcd(M)=1$ as the intersection of all MED numerical semigroups with multiplicity $m$. 

 Given a MED numerical semigroup $S$, we say that $M=\{m_1 < \cdots< m_k\}$ is a MED system of generators if the MED closure of $M$ is $S$. Moreover, $M$ is a minimal MED generating system for $S$ provided that every proper subset of $M$ is not a MED system of generators of $S$. Minimal MED generating systems are unique, and in general are smaller than
the classical minimal generating systems (see \cite{RGGB03}).

{
  Numerical semigroups with the Arf property are a special kind of numerical
semigroups with maximal embedding dimension. A numerical semigroup $S$ is Arf if for every $x,y,z$ in $S$ with $x\geq y\geq z$, one has that $x+y-z\in S$. 

 The intersection of two Arf numerical semigroups is again Arf, and thus we can
consider the Arf closure of a set of nonnegative integers with greatest common
divisor equal to one. Analogously as with MED numerical semigroups, we define
Arf systems of generators and minimal Arf generating system for an Arf
numerical semigroup. These are also unique(see \cite{RGGB04}).

  Saturated numerical semigroups with the Arf property are a special kind of
numerical semigroups with maximal embedding dimension. A numerical semigroup $S$ is saturated if the following condition holds: $ s, s_1 , \ldots , s_r$ in $S$ are such that $s_i \leq s$ for all $i$ in $\{1, \ldots , r\}$ and $z_1 , \ldots , z_r$ in $\mathbb Z$ are such that $z_1 s_1 + \cdots + z_r s_r\geq 0$, then $s + z_1 s_1 + \cdots + z_r s_r$ in $S$. 

 The intersection of two saturated numerical semigroups is again saturated, and

{
  Let $ S $ be a numerical semigroup minimally generated by $ \{m_1,\ldots,m_n\} $. A factorization of an element $s\in S$ is an n-tuple $ a=(a_1,\ldots,a_n) $ of nonnegative integers such that $ n=a_1 n_1+\cdots+a_n m_n$. The length of $a$ is $|a|=a_1+\cdots+a_n$. Given two factorizations $a$ and $b$ of $n$, the distance between $a$ and $b$ is $d(a,b)=\max \{ |a-\gcd(a,b)|,|b-\gcd(a,b)|\}$, where $\gcd((a_1,\ldots,a_n),(b_1,\ldots,b_n))=(\min(a_1,b_1),\ldots,\min(a_n,b_n))$. 

 If $l_1>\cdots > l_k$ are the lengths of all the factorizations of $s \in S$, the Delta set associated to $s$ is $\Delta(s)=\{l_1-l_2,\ldots,l_k-l_{k-1}\}$. 

 The catenary degree of an element in $S$ is the least positive integer $c$ such that for any two of its factorizations $a$ and $b$, there exists a chain of factorizations starting in $a$ and ending in $b$ and so that the distance between two consecutive links is at most $c$. The catenary degree of $S$ is the supremum of the catenary degrees of the elements in $S$. 

 The tame degree of $S$ is the least positive integer $t$ such that for any factorization $a$ of an element $s$ in $S$, and any $i$ such that $s-m_i\in S$, there exists another factorization $b$ of $s$ so that the distance to $a$ is at most $t$ and $b_i\not = 0$. 

 The $\omega$-primality of an element $s$ in $S$ is the least positive integer $k$ such that if $(\sum_{i\in I} s_i)-s\in S, s_i\in S$, then there exists $\Omega\subseteq I$ with cardinality $k$ such that $(\sum_{i\in \Omega} s_i)-s\in S$. The $\omega$-primality of $S$ is the maximum of the $\omega$-primality of its minimal generators. 

 The basic properties of these constants can be found in \cite{GHKb}. The algorithm used to compute the catenary and tame degree is an adaptation
of the algorithms appearing in \cite{CGLPR} for numerical semigroups (see \cite{CGL}). The computation of the elasticity of a numerical semigroup reduces to $m/n$ with $m$ the multiplicity of the semigroup and $n$ its largest minimal generator (see \cite{CHM06} or \cite{GHKb}).

  Let $ S $ be a numerical semigroup minimally generated by $ \{m_1,\ldots,m_n\} $. The homogenization of $S$, $S^\mathrm{hom}$ is the semigroup generated by $\{(1,0),(1,m_1),\ldots, (1,m_n)\}$. The catenary degree of $S^\mathrm{hom}$ coincides with the homogeneous catenary degree of $S$, and it is between the catenary and the monotone catenary degree of $S$. The advantage of this catenary degree is that is less costly to compute than
the monotone catenary degree, and has some nice interpretations (\cite{GSOSN}). This section contains the auxiliary functions needed to compute the
homogeneous catenary degree.

  Let $f(x,y)\in \mathbb K[x,y]$, with $\mathbb K$ an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let $f(x,y)=y^n+a_1(x)y^{n-1}+\dots+a_n(x)$ be a nonzero polynomial of $\mathbb K[x][y]$. After possibly a change of variables, we may assume that, that $\deg_x(a_i(x))\le i-1$ for all $i\in\{1,\ldots, n\}$. For $g\in\mathbb K[x,y]$ that is not a multiple of $f$, define $\mathrm{int}(f,g)=\dim_\mathbb K \frac{\mathbb K[x,y]}{(f,g)}$. If $f$ has one place at infinity, then the set $\{\mathrm{int}(f,g)\mid g\in\mathbb K[x,y]\setminus(f)\}$ is a free numerical semigroup (and thus a complete intersection).

\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{ Defining affine semigroups }}\logpage{[ 11, 1, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7E39DA7780D02DF5}{}
{
  An affine semigroup $S$ is a finitely generated cancellative monoid that is reduced (no units other
than 0) and is torsion-free ($ a s= b s$ implies $a=b$, with $a,b\in \mathbb N$ and $s\in S$). Up to isomorphisms any affine semigroup can be viewed as a finitely
generated submonoid of $\mathbb N^k$ for some positive integer $k$. Thus affine semigroups are a natural generalization of numerical semigroups.
The most common way to give an affine semigroup is by any of its systems of
generators. As for numerical semigroups, any affine semigroup admits a unique
minimal system of generators. A system of generators can be represented as a
list of lists of nonnegative integers; all lists in the list having the same
length (a matrix actually). If $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb Z^k$, then $S=G\cap \mathbb N^k$ is an affine semigroup (these semigroups are called full affine semigroups).
As $G$ can be represented by its defining equations (homogeneous and some of them
possibly in congruences), we can represent $S$ by the defining equations of $G$; indeed $S$ is just the set of nonnegative solutions of this system of equations. We can
represent the equations as a list of lists of integers, all with the same
length. Every list is a row of the matrix of coefficients of the system of
equations. For the equations in congruences, if we arrange them so that they
are the first ones in the list, we provide the corresponding moduli in a list.
So for instance, the equations $x+y\equiv 0\bmod 2,\ x-2y=0$ will be represented as [[1,1],[1,-2]] and the moduli [2]. 

 As happens with numerical semigroups, there are different ways to specify an
affine semigroup $S$, namely, by means of a system of generators, a system of homogeneous linear
Diophantine equations or a system of homogeneous linear Diophantine
inequalities, just to mention some. In this section we describe functions that
may be used to specify, in one of these ways, an affine semigroup in \textsf{GAP}.

 \texttt{List} is a list with two components. The first represents a matrix with integer
coefficients, say $A=(a_{ij})$, and so it is a list of lists of integers all with the same length. The
second component is a list of positive integers, say $d=(d_i)$, which may be empty. The list $d$ must be of length less than or equal to the length of $A$ (number of rows of $A$). 

 The output is the full semigroup of nonnegative integer solutions to the
system of homogeneous equations \\
 $a_{11}x_1+\cdots+a_{1n}x_n\equiv 0\bmod d_1, $\\
 $\cdots $\\

 $\cdots $\\
 $a_{m1}x_1+\cdots+a_{mn}x_n=0. $\\
  

 If $d$ is empty, then there will be no equations in congruences.

give an affine semigroup is by a set of homogeneous inequalities, and we can
represent these inequalities by its coefficients. If we put them in a matrix $S$ can be defined as the set of nonnegative integer solutions to $Ax \ge 0$.

Gr{\"o}bner basis computations and thus it is slower. Also in this case, from
the Gr{\"o}bner basis, a minimal set of generating binomials must be refined,
and for this Rclasses are used (if \texttt{NormalizInterface} is loaded, then the factorizations are faster). The \texttt{4ti2} implementation uses \texttt{4ti2} internal Gr{\"o}bner bases and factorizations are done via \texttt{zsolve}.

 \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape a}} is an affine semigroup. The output is the set of primitive elements of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape a}} (defined as for numerical semigroups). 

This function has three implementations (methods), one using Graver basis via
the Lawrence lifting of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape a}} and the other (much faster) using \texttt{NormalizInterface}. Also a \texttt{4ti2} version using its Graver basis computation is provided.

 If no extra package is loaded, then factorizations are computed recursively;
and thus slowly. If \texttt{NormalizInterface} is loaded, then a system of equations is solved with Normaliz, and the
performance is much better. If \texttt{4ti2Interface} is loaded instead, then factorizations are calculated using \texttt{zsolve} command of \texttt{4ti2}.

\chapter{\textcolor{Chapter }{ Good semigroups }}\logpage{[ 12, 0, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7A9271AC84C7277F}{}
{
   We will only cover here good semigroups of $\mathbb{N}^2$. 

 A good semigroup $S$ is a submonoid of $\mathbb{N}^2$, with the following properties. 

 (G1) It is closed under infimums (minimum componentwise). 

 (G2) if $a, b \in M$ and $a_i = b_i$ for some $i \in \{1, 2\}$, then there exists $c \in M$ such that $c_i > a_i = b_i$ and $c_j = \min\{a_j,b_j\}$, with $j{\ensuremath{\in}}\{1,2\}\setminus \{i\}$.

 (G3) there exists $C\in\mathbb{N}^n$ such that $C+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S$. 

 Value semigroups of algebroid branches are good semigroups, but there are good
semigroups that are not of this form. Since good semigroups are closed under
infimums, if $C_1$ and $C_2$ fulfill $C_i+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S$, then $C_1\wedge C_2+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S$. So there is a minimum $C$ fulfilling $C+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S$, which is called the conductor of $S$. 

 The contents of this chapter are described in \cite{DGSM}.

 A sequence of positive rational numbers $ a_1/b_1 < \cdots < a_n/b_n$ with $a_i,b_i$ positive integers is a \emph{B{\a'e}zout sequence} if $ a_{i+1}b_i - a_i b_{i+1}=1$ for all $i\in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}$.

{
 Ignacio and Carlos Jes{\a'u}s implemented the algorithms given in \cite{Roune} and \cite{MC-O-T} for the calculation of the Frobenius number and Ap{\a'e}ry set of a numerical
semigroup using Gr{\"o}bner basis calculations. These methods will be used if
4ti2 is loaded (either 4ti2Interface or 4ti2gap). A faster algorithm is
employed provided that singular is loaded. }
