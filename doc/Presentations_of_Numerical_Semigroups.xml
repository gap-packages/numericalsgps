                    <Description>
                        <A>S</A> is a numerical semigroup.
                        
                        The output is a list of lists with two elements. Each list of two elements represents
                        a relation between the minimal generators of the numerical semigroup. If 
                        <M> \{ \{x_1,y_1\},\ldots,\{x_k,y_k\}\} </M> is the output
                        and <M> \{m_1,\ldots,m_n\} </M> is the minimal system of generators 
                        of the numerical semigroup, then
                        <M> \{x_i,y_i\}=\{\{a_{i_1},\ldots,a_{i_n}\},\{b_{i_1},\ldots,b_{i_n}\}\}</M>
                        and <M> a_{i_1}m_1+\cdots+a_{i_n}m_n= b_{i_1}m_1+ \cdots +b_{i_n}m_n.</M>
                        <P/>
                        
                        Any other relation among the minimal generators of the semigroup can be deduced from 
                        the ones given in the output.
                        <P/>
                        
                        The algorithm implemented is described in <Cite Key="Ros96"></Cite>
                        (see also  <Cite Key="RGS99"></Cite>).

                        The first element in the list means that <M> 1\times 3+1\times 7=2\times 5 </M>,
                        and the others have similar meanings.

                        <A>S</A> is a numerical semigroup and <A>n</A> is an element in <A>S</A>.

                        The output is a pair. If <M> \{m_1,\ldots,m_n\} </M> is the set of minimal 
                        generators of <A>S</A>, then the first component is the set of vertices of the graph 
                        associated to <A>n</A> in <A>S</A>, that is, the set 
                        <M>\{ m_i \ |\  n-m_i\in S\} </M>, 
                        and the second component is the set of edges of this graph, that is,
