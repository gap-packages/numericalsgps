A good semigroup <M>S</M> is a submonoid of <M>\mathbb{N}^n</M>, for some positive <M>n</M>, that is closed under infimums (minimum componentwise) and there exists <M>C\in\mathbb{N}^n</M> such that <M>C+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S</M>. We will only cover here good semigroups of <M>\mathbb{N}^2</M>. <P/>

Value semigroups of algebroid branches are good semigroups, but there are good semigroups that are not of this form. Since good semigroups are closed under infimums, if <M>C_1</M> and <M>C_2</M> fulfill <M>C_i+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S</M>, then <M>C_1\wedge C_2+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S</M>. So there is a minimum <M>C</M> fulfilling <M>C+\mathbb{N}^n\subseteq S</M>, which is called the conductor of <M>S</M>. <P/>
