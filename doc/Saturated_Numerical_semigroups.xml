                    Saturated numerical semigroups
                </Heading>
                Saturated numerical semigroups with the Arf property are a special kind of numerical semigroups with 
                maximal embedding dimension. A numerical semigroup <M>S</M> is saturated if the following condition holds: <M> s, s_1 , \ldots , s_r</M> in <M>S</M>  are such that <M>s_i \leq s</M> for all <M>i</M> in <M>\{1, \ldots , r\}</M> and <M>z_1 , \ldots , z_r</M> in <M>\mathbb Z</M> are such that <M>z_1 s_1 + \cdots + z_r s_r\geq 0</M>, then <M>s + z_1 s_1 + \cdots + z_r s_r</M> in <M>S</M>.
                
                <P/> 
                The intersection of two saturated numerical semigroups is again saturated, and thus we can consider the 
                saturated closure of a set of nonnegative integers with greatest common divisor equal to one (see <Cite Key="RGbook"></Cite>).
