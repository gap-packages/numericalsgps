  <Heading>Wilf's conjecture</Heading>
  
  Let <M>S</M> be a numerical semigroup, with conductor <M>c</M> and embedding dimension <M>e</M>. Denote by <M>l</M> the cardinality of the set of elements in  <M>S</M> smaller than <M>c</M>. Wilf in <Cite Key="Wilf"></Cite> asked whether or not <M>l/c\ge 1/e</M> for all numerical semigroups. In this section we give some functions to experiment with this conjecture, as defined in <Cite Key="E"></Cite>.

      is a numerical semigroup.  Let <M>c</M>, <M>e</M> and <M>l</M> be the conductor, embedding dimension and number of  elements smaller than <M>c</M> in <A>S</A>. Returns <M>e l-c</M>, which was conjetured by Wilf to be nonnegative.

      <C>S</C> 
      is a numerical semigroup.  Let <M>c</M>, <M>m</M>, <M>s</M> and <M>l</M> be the conductor, multiplicity, number of generators smaller than <M>c</M>, and number of  elements smaller than <M>c</M> in <A>S</A>, respectively. Let <M>q</M> and <M>r</M> be the quotient and negative remainder of the division of <M>c</M> by <M>m</M>, that is, <M>c=qm-r</M>. Returns <M>s l-qd_q+r</M>, where <M>d_q</M> corresponds with the number of integers in <M>[c,c+m[</M> that are not minimal generators of <A>S</A>.

      is a numerical semigroup.  Let <M>c</M> and <M>m</M> be the conductor and  multiplicity of <A>S</A>, respectively. Let <M>q</M> and <M>r</M> be the quotient and nonpositive remainder of the division of <M>c</M> by <M>m</M>, that is, <M>c=qm-r</M>.

      <C>S</C> 
      is a numerical semigroup.  Let <M>c</M> and <M>m</M> be the conductor and  multiplicity of <A>S</A>, respectively. Let <M>q</M> and <M>r</M> be the quotient and negative remainder of the division of <M>c</M> by <M>m</M>, that is, <M>c=qm-r</M>.  Returns a list of lists of integers, each list is the set <M> S \cap [jm-r, (j+1)m-r[</M> with <M> j</M> in [1..q]. So this is a partition of the set of small elements of <A>S</A> (without <M>0</M>).
