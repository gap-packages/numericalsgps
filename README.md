NumericalSgps
=============

`NumericalSgps` is a GAP package for computing with Numerical Semigroups.


Introduction
------------

This is release 1.1.10 of  the package `NumericalSgps`.

The features of this package include

- defining numerical semigroups;
- computing several properties of numerical semigroups, namely: multiplicity, Frobenius number, (minimal) system of generators, Apéry set, gaps, fundamental gaps, etc.;
- perform several operations on numerical semigroups and ideals, namely: intersection, quotient by an integer, decompose into irreducible semigroups, add a special gap, ...;
-computing and testing membership to relevant families of numerical semigroups.

There is a manual in the sub-directory `doc` written using the GAP package
gapdoc which describes the available functions in detail. The pdf, html
versions of the manual are also available there.

If you have used this package, please let us know by sending
us an email.  If you  have found important features missing or if there is a
bug, we would appreciate it very much if you send us an email.

The current maintainers of the package are:

Manuel Delgado			<mdelgado@fc.up.pt>

Pedro A. García-Sánchez		<pedro@ugr.es>

Installation
------------
This package consists only of GAP code, so for its installation please refer to the [GAP manual](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap76.html#X82473E4B8756C6CD).

The maintainers want to thank the organizers of *GAPDays* in their several editions.

The authors also thank the Centro de Servicios de Informática y Redes de Comunicaciones (CSIRC), Universidad de Granada, for providing the computing time, specially Rafael Arco Arredondo for installing this package and the extra software needed in alhambra.ugr.es
