                   | CHANGES of the numericalsgps package |
                   ----------------------------------------
- fixed bug in the definition of proportionaly modular semigroups (affected the case a < c (in this case it should return the entire N) -- )
0.980 -> ...

- The function AperyListOfNumericalSemigroup has been added. It has only a numerical semigroup as argument and does the same than AperyListOfNumericalSemigroupWRTElement when considered relative to the multiplicity (which is, by far, the most important case). 

- The components of the objects "NumericalSemigroup" and "IdealOfNumericalSemigroup" became atributes. All "!." used either to access the components and to assign new values to them have been changed accordinly. It affected various files.

- ReducedSetOfGeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroup became just a synonym of MinimalGeneratingSystemOfNumericalSemigroup, since this function is now reasonably fast and the former one was not significantly used. The name was kept for compatibility with code produced for previous versions.
- GeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroupNC became a synonym of GeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroup. The former one had no interest. The name was kept for compatibility with code produced for previous versions.
0.971 -> 0.980

0.97 -> 0.971
- Fixed some bugs related to the numerical semigroup N. (These bugs did not produce wrong results.) 
- New functions added
	-SaturatedNumericalSemigroupClosure
	-IsSaturatedNumericalSemigroup
	-AsGluingOfNumericalSemigroups
	-IsACompleteIntersectionNumericalSemigroup

0.96 -> 0.97
- Removed (for the sake of non-dependencies and simplicity: in particular, the folder "src" so as the files "drawapery.g*" and "xnumsgp.g*" containing the functions below have been removed) 
	-DrawAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup
	-XDrawAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup
	-XNumericalSemigroup

- Improvements in 
	- MinimalGeneratingSystemOfNumericalSemigroup (the case of a semigroup given by generators is new)
	- NumericalSemigroup (when the generators form a range (i.e., an interval of integers); when the semigroup is given by a closed interval with rational ends or when the semigroup is given as a proportionally modular semigroup;  when the semigroup is given by two generators it is immediately seen as modular semigroup; modular semigroups are also proportionally modular semigroups and proportionally modular semigroups of proportion 1 are modular semigroups -- this information is stored so that specific algorithms can be immediately used)

	-ConductorOfNumericalSemigroup

- Improved methods for existing functions
	- FrobeniusNumberOfNumericalSemigroup (a new algorithm for modular NS)
	- FrobeniusNumberOfNumericalSemigroup (the general method now uses Johnson's reduction, when possible; a fast algorithm for semigroups of embedding dimension 3 has been implemented)
	- SmallElementsOfNumericalSemigroup (As a numerical semigroup generated by an interval is automatically proportionally modular, the method for PM semigroups is used)

- Added documentation for the new functions and for 
	-TameDegreeOfElementInNumericalSemigroup
